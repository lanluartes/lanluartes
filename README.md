## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Allan, a software developer with a passion to tinker with anything tech related. Lately, I've been primarily using **VueJS, React and Typescript.**

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [magkano-toll](https://magkano-toll.vercel.app/) and updating my NeoVim setup. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CSS in depth, NextJS, and Python!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can send me an email on amcluartes@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I wrote this on a [Corne Keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) which I flashed with my personal keyboard layout using QMK and C. I'm a keyboard geek ðŸ¤“

If you're interested to work with me, send me an email and let's finish that MVP! ðŸ˜„
